      Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Ashanti and I am 23 years old. I was
      born in Guyana but grew up and currently live in Brooklyn. I am currently
      a senior studying computer science at Brooklyn College and expected to
      graduate Spring 2026. I am interested in careers in various different
      computer science subfields such as UX Design, Web Development and Data
      Analysis. My long term goal is to eventually become a professor as I love
      talking to people and sharing knowledge. In my free time, I enjoy making
      digital art in procreate and painting.
    </p>
